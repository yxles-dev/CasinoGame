Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy.

Agree ahead of time whether you will count off rock, paper, scissors, shoot or just rock, paper, scissors.
Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time.


RULES:

(Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.)


ROCK (Rock beats scissors and loses to paper)

-Make a closed fist to throw a rock out. 
This powerful play is strong enough to break the fragile scissors, but cannot fight its way past the paper, which wraps itself around the rock to suffocate it.

PAPER (Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors) 

-Lay your fingers flat and keep them together to play paper. 
The slick and flexible paper wraps around the rock to lock it down, but it cannott fight back against the sharp scissors.

SCISSORS (Scissors beat paper but loses to rock) 

-Play scissors by making a peace sign with your index and middle finger. 
The sharp scissors carve through paper with ease, but they are too weak to stand up to a rock slamming into them.
